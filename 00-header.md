abstract: |
  ReScience is a peer-reviewed journal that target computational research and
  encourage the explicit replication of already published research promoting
  new and open-source implementations in order to ensure the original research
  is replicable. To achieve such a goal, the whole editing chain is radically
  different from any other traditional scientific journal. ReScience lives
  mainly on github where each new implementation is made available together
  with the comments, explanations and tests. Each submission takes the form of
  a pull request that is publicly reviewed and tested in order to guarantee any
  researcher can re-use it.
