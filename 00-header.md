abstract: |
  ReScience is a peer-reviewed journal that targets computational research and
  encourages the explicit replication of already published research thereby promoting
  new and open-source implementations in order to ensure the original research
  is replicable. To achieve such a goal, the whole editing chain is radically
  different traditional scientific journals. ReScience lives
  mainly on Github where each new article and code implementation is made available together
  with comments, explanations and tests. Each submission takes the form of
  a pull request that is publicly reviewed and tested in order to guarantee any
  researcher can re-use it.
